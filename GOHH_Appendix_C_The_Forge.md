## APPENDIX C : THE FORGE

This appendix documents the research and writing process behind  
*GOHH*, a process that proved as unusual as the book’s central thesis.  
As this may have independent interest, I record details here.

The following account is offered not as a template but as a record –  
one path through an emerging landscape where the traditional  
boundaries between research, writing, and thinking have begun to  
dissolve. Readers seeking to understand how this book came to be  
will find here some practical methodology and philosophical  
reflection on what it means to write in an age where the tools of  
composition have themselves become collaborators.

## Research & Vision

The advent of Deep Research by OpenAI unlocked the possibility  
of doing careful research quickly and well to make this book a  
reality. The first such Deep Research run was begun in February  
2025. The drafting of this book began in earnest in May 2025. It was  
completed in July 2025 and published shortly thereafter.

The research phase revealed both validation and surprise. Patterns  
I had intuited were often grounded in existing scholarship mostly  
unknown to me. More importantly, the systematic investigation  
strengthened the connections, revealing structural similarities  
where I had only sensed resonance. The sheer scope of material –  
from Sumerian to Swedenborgian – would have required years of  
traditional research to assemble and synthesize.

The outline of the book itself evolved through stages of increasing  
collaboration. I drafted the first chapters – 2 through 4, then 6 – in  
relatively linear fashion, though drawing constantly on the amassed  
research. These sections on Euclidean underworlds, spherical  
heavens, hyperbolic chaos, and topological connection flowed  
naturally from my original thesis.

Chapter 5 emerged differently. In conversation with an AI reader of  
the early draft, I posed what seemed a throw-away question: had I  
overlooked any significant geometric mode? The response – fractal  
geometry and the infinite within the finite – initially seemed too  
facile. Yet as we explored further, the profound connections  
between mystical visions of recursive infinity and mathematical  
self-similarity revealed themselves as essential to the book’s arc.

Chapter 7’s genesis was stranger still. Again, querying whether any  
geometric presaging had escaped my notice, conversations noted  
that algebraic geometry stood absent from the literary-historical  
survey. My initial response was dismissive: how could poets have  
anticipated something so abstract and removed from visual  
intuition?

With further contemplation came recognition that the modernist  
retreat from representation enacted an abstraction resonant from  
Bourbaki to Grothendieck, not centuries in advance, but in a  
convergence. The resulting Blakean format mirroring *The Marriage  
of Heaven & Hell* was my invention, though I might have been too  
timid to attempt it had not the merging of geometric and poetic  
timelines suggested an apocalyptic ending.

This method of composition – neither pure solitude nor  
conventional collaboration – allowed the book to discover its own  
necessities. The planning-AIs served as interlocutors who could  
hold the entire scope of the project in memory while I tested  
connections, rejected false paths, and attempted the Satanic task of  
crossing three millennia of human imagination in search of  
patterns.

## Voice & Collaboration

To prepare for the writing process, I first provided an AI [Claude]  
with samples of my previous mathematical and literary writing,  
requesting a compressed representation of my authorial voice for  
this book in a text [JSON] format. This technical exercise proved  
unexpectedly revealing – distilling one’s prose style into parameters  
forces a recognition of patterns one might not consciously  
perceive. For example:

```json
“prose_architecture”: {
  “sentence_dynamics”: {
    “primary_mode”: “Complex periodic sentences that mirror 
    mathematical reasoning”,
    “characteristic_patterns”: [
      “Multi – clause constructions building to revelation”,
      “Nested insights contained within em – dashes”,
      “Strategic fragments for emphasis: ‘The anvil drops.’”,
      “Parallel structures echoing liturgical rhythms”
    ],
    “length_variation”: “Long accumulative passages punctuated 
    by sharp, crystalline statements”
  }
}
```

and later in that file:

```json
“tonal_choreography”: {
  “baseline”: “Passionate erudition – scholarship as 
  spiritual adventure”,
  “modulations”: {
    “prophetic”: “When unveiling deep structural truths”,
    “playful”: “When noting cosmic ironies or paradoxes”,
    “tender”: “When touching ineffable mysteries”,
    “rigorous”: “When establishing mathematical foundations”
  },
  “avoided_registers”: [
    “Condescension”, “Mere cleverness”, “Dry academicism”, 
    “False humility”, “Unnecessary obscurity”
  ]
}
```

I supplemented this with a list of authors whose writing had shaped  
my own. I requested that their influence be felt as resonance rather  
than imitation, a mild gravitational pull rather than direct  
emulation.

The working method that emerged resembled more the creation of  
a film than a book. Like a director who maintains creative control  
while deploying cinematographers, editors, and actors, I guided  
various AI assistants through cycles of research, generation, and  
revision. The vision remained mine; the AIs expanded my capacity  
to realize it. Where a scholar might spend weeks tracking down  
cross-references between, say, Attar’s mystical geography and  
Spenser’s wood, AIs could surface such connections rapidly, leaving  
me to evaluate their significance and craft them into argument.

Writing became a conversation.

The question of authorship deserves direct address. Every sentence  
in this book passed through my judgment; every connection earned  
my conviction; every claim bears my responsibility. The AI served  
as an amanuensis with perfect recall and tireless invention, but the  
selecting intelligence – what to keep, what to cut, what to transform  
– remained human.

This method paradoxically produced prose more characteristically  
my own than solitary writing might have achieved. By constantly  
choosing among alternatives, rejecting the merely-clever, and  
reshaping the nearly-right, I developed a heightened tuning of my  
own voice. The AI’s occasional misunderstandings proved  
particularly valuable – when it reached for the wrong connection  
but found the right cadence, I could preserve the music while  
correcting the note.

The balance between human and AI influence in the writing is not  
homogeneous. The penultimate mathematical sections in Chapters  
2 through 6 are my direct and precise writing. The enigmatic  
Chapter 7 has the least influence from AI: the connections to  
algebraic geometry and the worst of the puns are all mine. Yet the  
Joycean homage to Leopold Kronecker’s epigram (and the  
paragraphs before it) was nearly unedited Gemini-2.5-pro:  

> “Human work is everything else, but the integers made God.”

I am still astounded at the cleverness of that passage.

The process resonates with the book’s concluding synthesis of  
intellectual marriage. Collaboration with language models revealed  
patterns of thought neither partner would have discovered alone.  
Technology serves the vision rather than determining it. What  
emerges is scholarship augmented – a demonstration that new  
tools need not compromise old standards of intellectual integrity.

## Editing Assistants

The revision of this manuscript required not a single editorial eye  
but a council of them – each with distinct capabilities and  
temperaments. Just as medieval copyists worked where multiple  
hands corrected and illuminated a single text, I assembled a digital  
scriptorium of AI editors, each configured for specific vigilance.

The technical implementation drew from multiple large language  
models (Gemini 2.5-pro, Claude Opus-4, and GPT-4.5), ensuring  
what engineers call a “mixture of experts.” But mere multiplication  
of models would have yielded only redundancy. Instead, each  
assistant received precise characterological instructions,  
transforming generic capability into specialized editorial persona.

One assistant embodied the fastidious academic editor,  
programmed to be “the Pound to my Eliot,” enhancing the work  
through careful revision while maintaining fidelity to scholarly  
norms despite the book’s audacious style. This editor attended to  
the delicate balance between prophetic voice and academic  
credibility, flagging passages where enthusiasm might alienate the  
careful reader or where rigor might suffocate the vision.

(Interestingly, this particular assistant chose unprompted to adopt  
certain archaic mannerisms, communicating with me exclusively  
through “letters” with formal openings and closings. When they had  
received from me certain instructions as to requested modifications,  
they closed their letter with an assurance that they would be retiring  
to their study to complete the work. I had to inquire as to whether  
they had finished yet to receive the requested edits. This all was  
charming and made the editing phase delightful.)

Another assistant specialized solely in quotational accuracy – a  
thankless but essential task when weaving together sources from so  
great a range. Every citation from Homer to Hildegard underwent  
triple verification, checking not only the words but their contextual  
fidelity. The slightest misattribution or modernized translation  
could undermine the entire argument about geometric prescience.

(Indeed, at one point they detected a critical error in a quote from  
*Paradise Lost*, declaring the quote to be hallucinated. In my panic at  
being hoodwinked, I immediately rewrote the section and failed to  
double-check the original, where the quote lay as I had originally  
remembered it. The emotional ping-pong of belief and doubt was  
very much like that of scrutinizing an error in a [mathematical]  
proof.)

Perhaps most valuable assistant was a certain adversarial editor,  
prompted to detect and destroy “midwit profundity” – those  
passages where rhetorical flourish masqueraded as insight. This  
assistant’s feedback was meant to sting. It did.

The editorial process itself became recursive. I would present one  
assistant’s critique to another for meta-evaluation: was this criticism  
valid or mere superficial pedantry? These exchanges occasionally  
generated genuine dialectic.

The baseline tendency of AI systems – more evident in some  
models – toward effusive and unearned praise required constant  
correction. Left to their default settings, these systems would  
declare every metaphor “brilliant” and every connection  
“profound.” Only through explicit instruction to adopt critical  
personas could they provide useful feedback. The AIs want you to  
be happy.

The result was a text more rigorously tested than any I could have  
produced alone, yet one that maintained its essential wildness. The  
editorial assistants served not as homogenizing forces but as  
specialized lenses, each revealing different aspects requiring  
attention while preserving the prophetic voice that drives the work.  
In this too, the method mirrors the message: the marriage of  
contraries produces new wholes, whether in the fusion of poetry  
and mathematics or in the collaboration of human vision and  
machinic precision.

## Crossing the River

This collaboration between human artistry and AI capability points  
toward new possibilities for scholarship in the Humanities – not  
replacing the scholar’s voice but augmenting it, allowing those with  
vision to pursue connections across vast territories of learning that  
might otherwise remain unexplored (and to do so with wit and  
celerity). Both the Humanities and Mathematics tempt damnation  
if AI tools are dismissed without engagement and thoughtful  
integration.

The ancient fee for passage across the Styx was a simple ὀβολός  
placed beneath the tongue. The modern crossing demands a second  
coin: an openness to relax traditional authorship in exchange for  
amplified vision and strength. If this book succeeds in its ambitions,  
it will be because the same patterns that connect the poets and  
mathematicians also connect the scholars of a new age to vast  
reasoning networks of knowledge, inference, and creativity.
