# Program Memo - Digital Transformation Program

This memo provides an executive summary of the Meridian Consulting Group Digital Transformation Program, synthesizing the field survey, architecture, lifecycle, and program plan into a single reference for stakeholders.

## Program Overview

Meridian Consulting Group is a 150-person professional services firm facing critical technology and operational challenges. Founded in 1998 and grown through acquisition, the firm operates with fragmented systems, inconsistent processes, and a culture that relies on senior partner relationships rather than institutionalized knowledge management.

Three forcing functions demand immediate action:

1. **Client Expectations:** Enterprise clients require secure collaboration platforms, real-time project dashboards, and demonstrated data governance—capabilities Meridian currently lacks
2. **Competitive Pressure:** Competitors offer integrated technology stacks that Meridian cannot match with current infrastructure
3. **Workforce Demographics:** 40% of staff are under 35 and expect modern tools; senior partners retiring within 5 years hold institutional knowledge that must be captured

The current state is unsustainable: $800K annual productivity loss from document management inefficiency, three lost RFPs citing technology gaps ($2M+ revenue opportunity), end-of-support email servers creating security exposure, and inability to pass enterprise security assessments limiting addressable market.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Sponsor** | Managing Partner Committee |
| **Recipient** | All Meridian Consulting Group |
| **Target Completion** | December 2027 |
| **Budget** | \$2.5M over 24 months |

> **Details:** See [[field-survey-digital-transformation]] for complete stakeholder inventory, resource analysis, pain points, and readiness assessment.

## What We're Building

### Goal State

The program delivers a modern, integrated technology platform enabling Meridian to compete effectively for enterprise clients, capture institutional knowledge before partner retirements, and provide the collaborative environment that attracts and retains talent. Staff can find any document in seconds, collaborate seamlessly across locations, and demonstrate security compliance to clients.

### Key Components

- **Cloud Collaboration Platform:** Microsoft 365 with Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive replacing on-premises email and file servers
- **Knowledge Management System:** Searchable repository with AI-assisted discovery capturing institutional expertise
- **Integrated CRM:** Salesforce or Dynamics 365 providing pipeline visibility and client relationship management
- **Modern Business Systems:** Cloud-based time/expense, integrated with accounting for real-time financial visibility
- **Security Infrastructure:** Zero Trust architecture with SOC 2 Type II compliance enabling enterprise client work

### Success Criteria

- Document search time reduced from 30 minutes to under 2 minutes
- SOC 2 Type II certification achieved by Month 18
- 85% staff adoption of core platform features by Month 24
- New consultant ramp time reduced from 6 months to 3 months
- Client security assessments passed without remediation findings
- Month-end close reduced from 10 days to 3 days

> **Details:** See [[architecture-digital-transformation]] for complete architecture documentation including capability model, technology selections, and security design.

## How We're Building It

### Development Approach

The program follows a V-model lifecycle designed to manage change across a 150-person organization while maintaining client delivery. A phased rollout strategy—Pilot (20 users), Wave 1 (40), Wave 2 (50), Wave 3 (40)—enables learning and refinement before firm-wide deployment.

This systematic approach ensures:
- Change Champions network prepares the organization for each wave
- Each phase verified before proceeding to next
- Adoption support and training precede each deployment
- Rollback capability maintained until stabilization confirmed

### Key Phases

| Phase Group | Purpose | Duration |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| Design | Requirements, architecture, platform selection, pilot preparation | 4 months |
| Implementation | Phased rollout across 4 waves with training and support | 14 months |
| Evaluation | Integration testing, security certification, acceptance | 4 months |
| Operations | Steady-state operations, continuous improvement, knowledge growth | Ongoing |

### Quality Assurance

The program distinguishes verification (confirming technical implementation meets specifications) from validation (confirming the solution meets stakeholder needs). Quality gates at each phase transition require explicit sign-off. The Champions network provides ongoing feedback to identify adoption barriers and usability issues before they become systemic.

timeline
    title Program Milestones
    section 2026
        M1 Design Complete : Apr 30 - Platform selected, pilot ready
        M2 Pilot Success : Jul 31 - 20 users live, lessons captured
        M3 Wave 1 Complete : Oct 31 - 60 total users
    section 2027
        M4 Wave 2 Complete : Feb 28 - 110 total users
        M5 Wave 3 Complete : May 31 - All 150 users
        M6 SOC 2 Certified : Sep 30 - Security compliance achieved
        M7 Program Complete : Dec 31 - Full operational capability
```

### Team and Resources

| Resource | Allocation |
|----------|------------|
| Total Budget | \$2.5M |
| Technology & Licensing | \$975K |
| Implementation Services | \$625K |
| Training & Adoption | \$250K |
| Change Management | \$200K |
| Contingency | \$250K |
| Program Duration | 24 months |
| Expected Annual Benefit | \$1.55M (productivity + reduced turnover + new revenue) |

### Top Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Partner resistance to change | High - adoption failure | Executive sponsorship visible; Champions from each practice; early wins communicated |
| Data migration errors | High - lost documents, broken links | Phased migration with validation; parallel operation period; rollback capability |
| Implementation partner performance | Medium - delays and rework | Milestone-based payments; weekly progress reviews; reference checks |
| Scope creep from practices | Medium - budget pressure | Governance board controls scope; change request process; reserve contingency |
| Staff productivity dip during transition | Medium - client delivery risk | Wave approach limits concurrent disruption; super-user support; buffer time |
