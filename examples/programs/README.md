# Program Development Examples

This directory contains example program documentation demonstrating how to apply the AAA framework to real-world systems engineering programs.

## Programs

### Bus Electrification Program

A municipal transit electrification program demonstrating the full V-model lifecycle:
- Program memo with stakeholder authorization
- Program plan with phased implementation strategy
- Architecture document with technical system design
- Lifecycle model spanning 25 years
- Field survey with site assessments

### Water Quality Monitoring Program

An IoT-based environmental monitoring program:
- Sensor network architecture
- Data pipeline design
- 10-year operational lifecycle
- Site assessments and sensor placement

### Digital Transformation Program

An enterprise digital transformation initiative:
- Technology modernization strategy
- Integration architecture
- Change management lifecycle

## Structure

Each program example includes:
- `*-program-memo-*.md` - Stakeholder authorization and scope
- `*-program-plan-*.md` - Implementation strategy
- `*-architecture-*.md` - Technical system design
- `*-lifecycle-*.md` - Operational model
- `*-field-survey-*.md` - Site assessments
- `assurance/` or `assurance-*/` - Assurance documentation

## Usage

These examples demonstrate how to structure program documentation using the AAA framework. They can be used as templates for new programs by:

1. Copying the relevant files
2. Adapting content to your specific program
3. Creating appropriate edges and faces
4. Running verification to ensure compliance

Note: These examples are dry runs demonstrating the structure. They are not connected to the main framework complex.
