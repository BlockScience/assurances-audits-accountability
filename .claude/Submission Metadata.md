## Title
Formalizing Document Assurance: A Topological Framework for Verification, Validation, and Human Accountability

## Abstract
As artificial intelligence increasingly assists systems engineering documentation, a critical question emerges: who is accountable for document quality? Current verification and validation frameworks lack formal mechanisms to integrate structural compliance with fitness-for-purpose, or to attribute accountability for subjective quality judgments.

We present a framework using typed simplicial complexes to formalize document assurance. Documents become vertices, verification and validation relationships become edges, and complete assurance forms triangular faces requiring both verification and validation with mandatory human accountability for fitness-for-purpose judgments. LLM assistance is tracked but cannot substitute for human sign-off.

We demonstrate through self-reference: this paper is verified against its specification, validated against its guidance, with assurance triangles completed by human approval. This proof-by-existence shows the framework is operational, enabling organizations to adopt AI assistance confidently while maintaining auditable chains of human responsibility.

## Program Notes
Who is accountable when AI assists systems engineering documentation? Current V&V frameworks lack formal mechanisms to integrate structural compliance with fitness-for-purpose or attribute responsibility for quality judgments. We present a topological framework using simplicial complexes where documents, verification, and validation form assurance triangles—complete only when human accountability is established. The paper demonstrates the framework through self-reference: it is itself an assured document with auditable chains of human responsibility.
