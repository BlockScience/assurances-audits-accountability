## IS 2026 Theme

### "Beyond Digital Engineering: Seeking Wa in SE"

**[Wa] (和) - Harmony**

> "While Digital Engineering (DE) continues to be a driving force in developing complex systems, today's societal challenges demand a more profound leap forward. The 2026 symposium will center on harmonizing emerging technologies with the irreplaceable power of human creativity and Kansei (sensibility), all guided by Wa, the Japanese concept of harmony."

**Key Theme Questions:**
- How can Human Systems Integration (HSI) forge the essential synergy between human ingenuity, Kansei, and advanced technologies like AI?
- What vital skills will systems engineers need to thrive in this new era of evolving DE?
- How can a human-centric, nature-harmonized approach illuminate the path for systems engineering to lead the shaping of our future world?
