# Guidance Type Template

**Guidances define quality criteria, best practices, and "how well" evaluations.**

Guidances extend docs and serve as the qualitative authority in the assurance triangle.

## Type Hierarchy

```
vertex (abstract)
└── doc (concrete)
    └── guidance (concrete) ← YOU ARE HERE
```

## Inheritance

- **Extends:** `doc`
- **Extended by:** None (terminal type in this hierarchy)
- **Instantiable:** Yes

## Required Frontmatter Fields

Inherits all doc/vertex fields, plus:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Must be `vertex/guidance` |
| `extends` | string | Must be `doc` |
| `tags` | array | Must include `[vertex, doc, guidance]` |

## Tag Requirements

The `tags` array MUST include the full inheritance chain:

```yaml
tags:
  - vertex      # base type
  - doc         # parent type
  - guidance    # concrete type
```

## Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `dependencies` | array | List of guidance IDs this guidance depends on (compositional dependencies) |
| `criteria` | array | Enumerated evaluation criteria |
| `rubric` | object | Scoring rubric for assessment |
| `examples` | object | Good/bad examples |

### Dependencies Field

The `dependencies` field declares compositional dependencies - other guidances that this guidance references or builds upon:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - v:guidance:persona
  - v:guidance:purpose
  - v:guidance:protocol
```

- **Empty array if no dependencies:** Guidances without compositional dependencies should use `dependencies: []` or omit the field
- **Used for compositional guidances:** When a guidance references quality criteria from other guidances (like system_prompt guidance references persona, purpose, protocol guidances)
- **Parallel to spec dependencies:** Guidances typically have dependencies parallel to their corresponding specs
- **Enables dependency tracking:** Tools can use this to understand compositional relationships
- **Creates dependency edges:** Each dependency should have a corresponding `edge/dependency` connecting the guidances

## Body Content

Guidance bodies should contain:
- **Quality criteria** - What makes a good/excellent instance
- **Best practices** - Recommended approaches
- **Anti-patterns** - Common mistakes to avoid
- **Assessment methodology** - How to evaluate conformance
- **Examples** - Concrete instances with quality commentary

## Role in Assurance Pattern

Guidances participate as **parent_guidance** in assurance faces:

```
          child_doc
           /      \
          /        \
  verification   validation
        /            \
       /              \
   parent_spec ---- parent_guidance
              coupling
```

- **Validation edges** point from docs to guidances (doc → guidance)
- Guidances define "how to assess quality"
- Guidances are coupled with specs that define structure

## Self-Referential Bootstrap

The knowledge complex requires:
- **guidance-for-guidance** - A guidance that defines how to evaluate guidance quality
- This guidance validates itself, creating the foundation for all other guidances

## Guidance vs. Spec

| Aspect | Spec | Guidance |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Answers** | "What?" | "How well?" |
| **Focus** | Structure, schema, requirements | Quality, best practices, evaluation |
| **Edge** | Verification | Validation |
| **Nature** | Prescriptive | Descriptive/evaluative |
| **Check** | Pass/fail (structural) | Assessed quality level |

## Example Instance

```yaml

id: v:guidance:documentation-quality

  - vertex
  - doc
  - guidance

# Documentation Quality Guidance

Criteria for evaluating the quality of technical documentation.

## Quality Criteria

### 1. Clarity
- **Excellent:** Concepts explained with precise, unambiguous language
- **Good:** Generally clear with minor ambiguities
- **Needs Improvement:** Frequent unclear or confusing passages

### 2. Completeness
- **Excellent:** All necessary information present with appropriate detail
- **Good:** Core information present, minor gaps
- **Needs Improvement:** Significant information missing

### 3. Examples
- **Excellent:** Multiple concrete examples covering common and edge cases
- **Good:** Basic examples provided
- **Needs Improvement:** Few or no examples

## Assessment Methodology

1. Read document in full
2. Evaluate against each criterion
3. Provide specific feedback with references
4. Assign overall quality rating

## Anti-Patterns

- Wall-of-text without structure
- Assumptions about reader knowledge
- Outdated examples
- Missing context or prerequisites
```

## Validation Rules

1. **Type Format:** `type` must be `vertex/guidance`
2. **Tag Chain:** Tags must include `[vertex, doc, guidance]`
3. **Extends:** Must extend `doc`
4. **Validation Target:** Can be target of validation edges
5. **Coupling:** Should be coupled with corresponding spec
6. **Content:** Body should define quality criteria and assessment methods
