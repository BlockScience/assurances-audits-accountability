## Template Usage Notes

### When to Create an Assurance Audit Chart

Create an assurance audit chart when:
- **Validation Required:** Need to verify all vertices have valid assurance
- **Trust Establishment:** Need to establish trust in a subset of the complex
- **Compliance Check:** Need to verify compliance with assurance specifications
- **Quality Gate:** Need to validate assurance before proceeding

### Assurance Audit Requirements

**Hard Requirements (MUST):**
1. ✅ Every vertex in the chart MUST have at least one valid assurance face
2. ✅ All assurance faces MUST form valid triangles (3 edges, 3 vertices)
3. ✅ All verification edges MUST have structural check results
4. ✅ All validation edges MUST have quality assessments
5. ✅ Chart MUST document assurance status for every vertex

**Soft Requirements (SHOULD):**
- Should use standard assurance faces where possible
- Should use boundary assurance (b2) only for self-referential foundational vertices
- Should document any assurance gaps
- Should provide remediation plan for gaps

**Restrictions:**
- Cannot include vertices without assurance (unless documenting gaps)
- Cannot include invalid assurance faces
- Cannot claim PASS status with unassured vertices

### Audit Statuses

**PASS:** All vertices have valid assurance, no critical issues
**PARTIAL:** Some vertices have valid assurance, some gaps exist
**FAIL:** Critical vertices lack assurance or have invalid assurance

### Assurance Types

**Standard Assurance (f:):**
- Coupling: Spec ↔ Guidance
- Verification: Document → Spec (structural checks)
- Validation: Document → Guidance (quality assessment)

**Boundary Assurance (b2:):**
- For self-referential foundational vertices only
- Uses b0:root as proxy
- Uses b1 boundary edges
- Resolves self-referential paradox

**Mixed:**
- Some vertices use standard, some use boundary
- Document which vertices use which type
- Justify the configuration

---

**Note:** Assurance audit charts are special restricted charts that validate the assurance state of a portion of the knowledge complex. Unlike general charts that can include any elements, assurance audits MUST verify that every vertex has valid assurance. They serve as quality gates and trust anchors.
