# Quickstart: Exploring in Obsidian

This guide gets you navigating the knowledge complex in Obsidian in under 5 minutes.

---

## 1. Install Obsidian

Download from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) if you haven't already.

## 2. Open as Vault

1. Launch Obsidian
2. Click **Open folder as vault**
3. Select this repository folder (`assurances-audits-accountability`)
4. Click **Open**

Obsidian will index all markdown files and resolve wikilinks automatically.

## 3. Start Navigating

Open [[NAVIGATION]] as your central hub. From there you can explore:

| Destination | What You'll Find |
|-------------|------------------|
| [[00_vertices/README]] | 56 document vertices (specs, guidance, content) |
| [[01_edges/README]] | 148 relationship edges (verification, validation, coupling) |
| [[02_faces/README]] | 65 triangular faces (assurance, signature, boundary) |
| [[charts/README]] | Composed subcomplexes with visualizations |

---

## 4. Use the Graph View

Press `Ctrl/Cmd + G` to open the graph view. You'll see the entire knowledge complex as an interactive network.

**Tips:**
- Drag nodes to explore clusters
- Click any node to open that document
- Use filters to show only certain file types

---

## 5. Follow Wikilinks

Every `[[wikilink]]` is clickable. The structure is designed for exploration:

- **From any document:** Click links to related specs, guidance, or edges
- **Backlinks panel:** See what documents reference the current one (right sidebar)
- **Hover preview:** Hold `Ctrl/Cmd` while hovering over a link to preview

## 7. Optional: Enable Templater

If you want to create new documents using the templates:

1. Go to **Settings → Community plugins**
