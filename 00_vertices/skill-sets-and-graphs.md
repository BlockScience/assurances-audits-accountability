# Sets and Graphs

## Purpose

This skill defines basic understanding of sets, graphs, and dimensional concepts as a foundational prerequisite for knowledge complex education. This is assumed prior knowledge, not taught within the knowledge complex curriculum.

## Property Definition

**Sets and graphs** is a general mathematical and computer science capability encompassing:
- **Set theory basics:** Understanding sets, unions, intersections, and set operations
- **Graph structures:** Understanding vertices (nodes) and edges (connections) in graph structures
- **Dimensional awareness:** Recognizing 0-dimensional (points), 1-dimensional (lines), and 2-dimensional (surfaces) elements
- **Graph visualization:** Ability to read and interpret graph diagrams
- **Boundary intuition:** Understanding that edges connect vertices, faces are bounded by edges

This is an **entry prerequisite** - learners should possess this before beginning knowledge complex studies.

## Acquisition

This skill is typically **acquired prior to** knowledge complex education through:
- General computer science coursework
- Self-study of basic data structures
- Practical experience with network diagrams
- Informal exposure to graph concepts (social networks, maps, etc.)

**Not taught by knowledge complex modules** - this is assumed background.

## Applicable Actors

This skill can be possessed by:
- **`vertex/student`**: Entry-level students beginning knowledge complex education
- **`vertex/actor`**: Any actor with basic technical literacy

## Learning Outcomes

After acquiring this skill (prior to knowledge complex study), a learner can:

- **Identify** nodes and edges in a simple graph diagram
- **Understand** that edges connect nodes
- **Read** basic graph visualizations
- **Grasp** informal concepts of connectivity and networks

## Prerequisite Skills

None - this is foundational general knowledge.

## Enables

Possessing this skill enables:

- **[[v:learning-module:simplicial-complex-fundamentals]]**: Required prerequisite for first module
- General readiness for structured knowledge representation topics

## Assessment Methods

Entry-level proficiency demonstrated by:
- Can identify nodes and edges in a simple diagram
- Understands what "connected" means in graph context
- Has seen or worked with graph-like structures before

**Standard:** Informal self-assessment - if learner has seen graphs before, they likely have this skill.

**Note:** This is an **entry prerequisite skill** assumed to exist before knowledge complex education begins. It is not taught by any module in the curriculum but is required for the first module.
