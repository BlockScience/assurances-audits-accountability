# Guidance for INCOSE IS 2026 Research Paper

## Purpose Statement

While spec-for-incose-paper defines what structural elements must be present, this guidance helps authors assess **how well** a paper serves its purpose of contributing to the INCOSE community. Great INCOSE papers are rigorous, accessible, engaging, and demonstrate clear value to systems engineering practice.

## Document Overview

### What This Guidance Covers

This guidance supports authors creating INCOSE symposium papers by providing:

- Quality assessment criteria specific to SE academic writing
- Best practices for communicating with diverse SE audiences
- Section-by-section authoring recommendations
- Common pitfalls in INCOSE submissions
- Theme alignment strategies for IS 2026

### Best Use Cases

Use this guidance when:

- Creating a new INCOSE symposium paper
- Reviewing a draft for quality before submission
- Assessing whether a paper will resonate with INCOSE reviewers
- Teaching others how to write effective SE papers
- Connecting research to the 2026 theme "Seeking Wa in SE"

### Not Intended For

- Checking structural compliance (use spec-for-incose-paper)
- Template formatting issues (use INCOSE template guide)
- Non-SE academic papers (guidance is SE-specific)

## Quality Criteria

### 1. Relevance to SE Community

**Excellent:**

- Addresses a clearly identified SE challenge that practitioners face
- Contribution to SE practice is explicit and compelling
- Paper explains why this matters to the INCOSE community

## Section-by-Section Guidance

### Title

**Purpose:** Attract readers and convey paper's essence

**Tips:**

- Be descriptive but concise (typically 8-15 words)
- Include key SE terminology for discoverability
- Avoid generic titles ("A Study of...", "An Approach to...")
- Consider including method and domain
- Theme keywords can help if naturally fitting

**Anti-patterns:**

- "A Novel Framework for..." (too generic)
- Titles that could apply to any field
- Acronym-heavy titles without explanation

### Abstract

**Purpose:** Summarize the complete paper in 150-300 words

**Tips:**

- Follow structure: Problem, Approach, Results, Contribution
- First sentence should hook the reader with the SE challenge
- Be specific about what you did and found
- End with clear statement of contribution
- Self-contained (no references, no undefined acronyms)

**Quality Indicators:**

- Could someone decide relevance from abstract alone?
- Are key results mentioned with specificity?
- Is the "so what?" answered?

### Introduction

**Purpose:** Motivate the work and orient the reader

**Tips:**

- Open with the SE challenge (not background)
- Establish why this matters to practitioners

- Frame AI as tool, emphasize human intellectual contribution
- Follow INCOSE disclosure format

**Example AI Disclosure:**

> "Claude Opus 4.5 assisted with drafting methodology sections and document verification. All research design, framework architecture, and conclusions are original author work. The author maintained oversight of all AI-assisted content."

## Workflow Guidance

### Recommended Authoring Sequence

1. **Define Core Contribution** (30 min)
   - What is the SE challenge?
   - What is your novel contribution?
   - Why should INCOSE audience care?

2. **Create Detailed Outline** (1-2 hours)
   - Map all sections with key points
   - Identify figures/tables needed
   - Estimate word allocation per section

3. **Draft Core Sections** (4-6 hours)
   - Methodology first (what you did)
   - Results second (what you found)
   - Discussion third (what it means)

4. **Frame the Paper** (2-3 hours)
   - Introduction (now that you know what you're introducing)
   - Background (positioned against your contribution)
   - Conclusion (summarizing what you've presented)

5. **Write Abstract** (1 hour)
   - Last, after paper content is stable
   - Summarize all key elements

6. **Review and Refine** (2-3 hours)
   - Check word count
   - Verify all claims have evidence
   - Ensure accessibility
   - Add theme connections

7. **Final Polish** (1-2 hours)
   - AI disclosure statement
   - Reference check
   - Template formatting
   - Proofread

**Total estimated time:** 12-18 hours for a quality submission

### Quality Checkpoints

- **After step 1:** Is the contribution specific and defensible?
- **After step 3:** Do results support claimed contribution?
- **After step 4:** Is the "why should I care?" clear in introduction?
- **After step 6:** Would a practitioner find this useful?
- **After step 7:** Does it meet all spec requirements?

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Problem | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Weak Motivation** | "We did X" without explaining why X matters | Start with practitioner pain point, then introduce solution |
| **Overclaiming** | "Revolutionary breakthrough" without evidence | Match claim strength to evidence; be specific about scope |
| **Jargon Overload** | Paper only readable by narrow specialists | Define terms; consider practitioner audience first |
| **Missing Validation** | Framework proposed but not demonstrated | Include case study, example application, or evaluation |
| **Theme Disconnect** | Paper ignores IS 2026 theme entirely | Find natural connection to human-AI harmony, HSI |
| **Passive Voice** | "It was found that..." throughout | Use active voice: "We found..." or "The results show..." |
| **Figure Overload** | 10 figures for 7000 words | 3-5 well-designed figures maximum; each must earn its space |
| **Weak Conclusion** | "Future work includes..." as main ending | End with impact: what changes because of this work? |

## Best Practices

1. **Lead with the Challenge** - Open with the SE problem, not background

2. **Write for Practitioners** - Your primary audience is working systems engineers, not academics

3. **Show, Don't Just Tell** - Concrete examples beat abstract claims

4. **Quantify When Possible** - Numbers are more compelling than vague improvements

5. **Be Honest About Limitations** - Acknowledging scope increases credibility

6. **Connect to Practice** - Always answer "so what does this mean for my project?"

7. **Embrace the Theme** - "Seeking Wa" aligns naturally with human-AI collaboration topics

8. **Use Figures Strategically** - One great diagram can communicate what 500 words cannot

9. **Front-Load Key Points** - Don't bury the contribution in section 5

10. **Respect the Word Limit** - Concision is a feature, not a constraint

11. **Get External Review** - Fresh eyes catch what you've become blind to

12. **Check Accessibility** - Read aloud; if it's hard to say, it's hard to read

## Validation vs. Verification

**Verification** (deterministic, against spec-for-incose-paper):

- Is word count under 7,000?
- Are all required sections present?
- Is AI disclosure included?
- Does it use INCOSE template?

**Validation** (qualitative, against this guidance):

- Is the SE challenge compelling?
- Is the paper accessible to practitioners?
- Are claims supported by appropriate evidence?
- Will it spark discussion at the symposium?
- Does it connect meaningfully to the theme?

This guidance supports **validation** - assessing fitness-for-purpose.

## Self-Consistency

This guidance document demonstrates the quality criteria it defines:

- **Relevance:** Specifically addresses INCOSE paper authoring challenges
- **Accessibility:** Clear language, structured for scannability
- **Rigor:** Criteria are specific and assessable
- **Contribution:** Provides actionable guidance not found in generic paper-writing advice
- **Theme Alignment:** Naturally connects to human-AI collaboration (AI disclosure)
