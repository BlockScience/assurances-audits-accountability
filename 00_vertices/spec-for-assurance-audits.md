# Specification for Assurance Audit Documents

**This specification defines the structure and requirements for all assurance audit chart documents in the knowledge complex.**

## Purpose

Assurance audit charts are special restricted charts that validate the assurance state of a portion of the knowledge complex. Unlike general charts that can include any elements, assurance audits MUST verify that every vertex has valid assurance. They serve as quality gates and trust anchors.

This spec-for-assurance-audits extends spec-for-charts with additional requirements specific to assurance auditing.

## Inheritance

```
doc → chart → assurance_audit
```

Assurance audit documents:
- MUST satisfy all requirements of spec-for-charts
- MUST satisfy additional assurance-specific requirements defined below

## Required Frontmatter Fields

### Type Declaration

| Field | Type | Requirement | Value |
|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| `type` | string | REQUIRED | Must be `chart/assurance_audit` |
| `extends` | string | REQUIRED | Must be `chart` |

### Assurance Audit Metadata

| Field | Type | Requirement | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `audit_date` | datetime | REQUIRED | ISO 8601 timestamp when audit was performed |
| `auditor` | string | REQUIRED | Person or system performing the audit |
| `audit_status` | enum | REQUIRED | One of: `PASS`, `FAIL`, `PARTIAL` |
| `audit_coverage` | string | REQUIRED | Description of coverage (e.g., "100% (5/5 vertices)") |

### Assurance Requirements

| Field | Type | Requirement | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| `assurance_requirements.all_vertices_assured` | boolean | REQUIRED | Must be `true` for PASS status |
| `assurance_requirements.assurance_method` | enum | REQUIRED | One of: `standard`, `boundary`, `mixed` |
| `assurance_requirements.minimum_assurance_level` | enum | REQUIRED | One of: `ASSURED`, `VERIFIED`, `VALIDATED` |

## Required Sections

All assurance audit documents MUST include the following markdown sections:

### 1. Assurance Audit Results

**Purpose:** Document the audit findings

**Required Subsections:**
- **Overall Audit Status** - PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with date, auditor, coverage
- **Vertex Assurance Status** - Table showing each vertex and its assurance status
- **Assurance Face Validation** - Table showing each assurance face and its validity
- **Assurance Coverage Analysis** - Breakdown by assurance type
- **Compliance Assessment** - Against Assurance Triangle Specification

### 2. Audit Trail

**Purpose:** Document the audit trail showing assurance trace back to root

**Required Content:**

- Audit trail for each audit target vertex
- Trace network showing dependency chain
- Boundary faces reached in trace
- Root anchoring confirmation

**Tool:** Generated by `scripts/audit_assurance_chart.py` using algorithms from Appendix D of the Assurance Triangle Specification

**Format:**

- Vertex-by-vertex audit results
- Assurance faces for each vertex
- Trace length and path to boundary complex
- Root anchored status (YES/NO)

### 3. Verification

**Purpose:** Provide commands to reproduce audit results

**Required Content:**
- Commands to verify chart structure
- Commands to validate assurance faces
- Commands to check assurance coverage
- Command to generate audit trail
- Expected results

## Assurance Audit Requirements

### Hard Requirements (MUST)

1. **Complete Coverage:** Every vertex in the audit MUST have at least one valid assurance face
2. **Root Anchored:** All assurance MUST trace back to boundary complex (b2:spec-spec or b2:guidance-guidance)
3. **Valid Triangles:** All assurance faces MUST form valid triangles (3 edges, 3 vertices)
4. **Structural Checks:** All verification edges MUST have structural check results
5. **Quality Assessments:** All validation edges MUST have quality assessments
6. **Documentation:** Chart MUST document assurance status for every vertex
7. **Audit Trail:** Chart MUST include audit trail showing trace to root

### Soft Requirements (SHOULD)

1. **Standard First:** Should use standard assurance faces where possible
2. **Boundary Sparingly:** Should use boundary assurance (b2) only for self-referential foundational vertices
3. **Gap Documentation:** Should document any assurance gaps
4. **Remediation:** Should provide remediation plan for gaps

### Restrictions

1. **No Unassured Vertices:** Cannot claim PASS status with unassured vertices (except root)
2. **No Invalid Faces:** Cannot include invalid assurance faces
3. **Evidence Required:** Must provide evidence of assurance validity

## Audit Status Definitions

### PASS

**Criteria:**
- All vertices have valid assurance (except root which provides assurance)
- All assurance faces are structurally valid
- All verification edges pass checks
- All validation edges have quality assessments
- No critical issues identified

### PARTIAL

**Criteria:**
- Some vertices have valid assurance
- Some assurance gaps exist
- Issues are documented with remediation plan
- Non-critical vertices may lack assurance

### FAIL

**Criteria:**
- Critical vertices lack assurance
- Invalid assurance faces present
- Verification checks failing
- Validation missing or inadequate

## Assurance Types

### Standard Assurance (f:)

**Structure:**
- Coupling: Spec ↔ Guidance (undirected)
- Verification: Document → Spec (directed, structural checks)
- Validation: Document → Guidance (directed, quality assessment)

**Use Case:** Regular documents that are not self-referential

### Boundary Assurance (b2:)

**Structure:**
- Uses b0:root vertex as anchor
- Uses b1 boundary edges (to/from root)
- Resolves self-referential paradox

**Use Case:** Self-referential foundational vertices (SS, GG) only

### Mixed Assurance

**Structure:**
- Vertex participates in both standard and boundary faces
- Some edges standard, some boundary

**Use Case:** Vertices that participate in multiple assurance triangles

## Validation Rules

### Vertex Assurance Validation

For each vertex in the audit:

```
ASSERT: vertex.id IN audit.elements.vertices
ASSERT: COUNT(faces WHERE vertex IN face.vertices) >= 1
ASSERT: ALL faces are VALID
```

Special case: Root vertex (b0:root) provides assurance but is not assured itself

### Face Validity Validation

For each assurance face:

```
ASSERT: face.vertices.length == 3
ASSERT: face.edges.length == 3
ASSERT: ALL edges connect vertices in face.vertices
ASSERT: Forms valid triangle (no degenerate edges)
```

### Edge Validity Validation

For verification edges:
```
ASSERT: edge.checks EXISTS
ASSERT: edge.checks.passed >= 0
ASSERT: edge.checks.total >= edge.checks.passed
```

For validation edges:
```
ASSERT: edge.assessment EXISTS
ASSERT: edge.quality_level IN {Excellent, Good, Adequate, Poor}
```

## Quality Criteria

### Excellent Audit

- 100% vertex coverage
- All faces valid
- All edges passing
- Clear documentation
- Reproducible results

### Good Audit

- >= 90% vertex coverage
- Minor gaps documented
- Remediation plan present
- Most edges passing

### Adequate Audit

- >= 75% vertex coverage
- Gaps identified
- Some remediation started
- Critical vertices assured

### Poor Audit

- < 75% coverage
- Undocumented gaps
- No remediation plan
- Critical vertices may be unassured

## Compliance

Assurance audit documents MUST comply with:

1. **This Specification:** All requirements defined herein
2. **Spec-for-Charts:** Parent specification requirements
3. **Assurance Triangle Specification:** Mathematical structure requirements
4. **Template Structure:** Standard chart template sections

## Verification Procedure

To verify an assurance audit document:

1. **Check Type:** Verify `type: chart/assurance_audit`
2. **Check Frontmatter:** Verify all required fields present
3. **Check Sections:** Verify all required sections present
4. **Check Coverage:** Verify all vertices have assurance
5. **Check Faces:** Verify all assurance faces valid
6. **Check Edges:** Verify all edges have validation results
7. **Check Status:** Verify status matches coverage (PASS requires 100%)

## Examples

### Minimal Passing Audit

```yaml
type: chart/assurance_audit
extends: chart
audit_status: PASS
audit_coverage: 100% (2/2 vertices)
assurance_requirements:
  all_vertices_assured: true
  assurance_method: standard
  minimum_assurance_level: ASSURED
```

### Complex Mixed Audit

```yaml
type: chart/assurance_audit
extends: chart
audit_status: PASS
audit_coverage: 100% (5/5 vertices)
assurance_requirements:
  all_vertices_assured: true
  assurance_method: mixed
  minimum_assurance_level: ASSURED
```
