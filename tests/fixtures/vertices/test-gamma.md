# Test Vertex Gamma

Generic test vertex for validating the knowledge complex toolchain.

Part of the tetrahedron test chart demonstrating basic simplicial complex structure.

## Purpose

This vertex serves as one corner of a test tetrahedron with a deliberate topological hole, used to validate:
- YAML frontmatter parsing
- Type system compliance
- Simplicial complex construction
- Hole detection in topology analysis
