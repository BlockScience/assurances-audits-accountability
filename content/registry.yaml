# Content Registry
# Defines directories that contain knowledge complex elements
# Used by cache builder and other tools to locate content

version: "1.0"

# Domain packs - each domain has a pack.yaml with full metadata
# This registry provides quick lookup; pack.yaml has authoritative details
#
# Tier hierarchy:
#   Tier 0: boundary (genesis bootstrap - SS, SG, GS, GG)
#   Tier 1: foundation (ontology layer)
#   Tier 2: meta (infrastructure specs - charts, factories)
#   Tier 3: domain packs (ppp, rbac, learning, architecture) - all peers
#   Tier 4: planning (depends on architecture)
