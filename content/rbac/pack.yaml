# This pack provides signer, role, and authorization infrastructure

name: rbac
version: 1.0.0
description: |
  Role-Based Access Control for knowledge complexes.
  Provides signer and role types, authorization edges, and signature faces
  for establishing human accountability in validation chains.

  - boundary    # genesis bootstrap
  - foundation  # ontology layer
  - meta        # infrastructure specs (charts, assurance faces)
