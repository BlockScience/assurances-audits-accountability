# This pack provides document types for defining AI system configurations

name: ppp
version: 1.0.0
description: |
  Persona-Purpose-Protocol framework for AI system documentation.
  Defines three coupled document types that together specify an AI assistant's
  identity (persona), objectives (purpose), and operational procedures (protocol).

dependencies:
  - foundation  # requires base ontology and genesis elements

# Ontology extensions (vertex types this pack introduces)
ontology:
  vertex_types:
    persona:

    actor:
      extends: doc
      description: Named entity that can perform actions (broader than persona)

# Domain-specific rules
rules:
  # Rule: PPP documents should form complete triads

    description: A persona should have corresponding purpose and protocol
    severity: warning

  # Rule: System prompts should reference their source PPP documents
  system_prompt_sources:
    description: System prompts should link to source persona, purpose, protocol
    severity: warning
