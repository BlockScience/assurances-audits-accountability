Document Development: Simplicial Complexes for Verification, Validation,
and Assurance with Human Accountability</h1>
<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>As artificial intelligence increasingly assists systems engineering
documentation, a critical question emerges: who is accountable for
document quality? Current verification and validation frameworks treat
structural compliance and fitness-for-purpose as separate concerns,
lacking formal mechanisms to integrate them or attribute accountability
for subjective quality judgments. This gap creates risk in AI-assisted
workflows where generated content may satisfy structural requirements
while failing to serve its intended purpose.</p>
<p>We present a framework using typed simplicial complexes to formalize
document assurance. Documents become vertices, verification and
validation relationships become edges, and complete assurance forms
triangular faces (2-simplices). The framework introduces three
innovations: explicit coupling edges that pair specifications with
corresponding guidance documents, assurance triangles that require both
verification and validation for completeness, and mandatory human
accountability for all validation judgments. Large language model
assistance is tracked but cannot substitute for human sign-off on
fitness-for-purpose assessments.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the framework through self-reference: this paper is
itself an instance of the framework, verified against its specification,
validated against its guidance, with the assurance triangle completed by
human approval. Four assured supporting documents—architecture,
lifecycle, literature review, and novel contributions—provide the
intellectual foundation, each with complete assurance chains. Audit
tooling confirms 100% assurance coverage with valid topological
invariants. This proof-by-existence shows the framework is not merely
described but operational.</p>
<p>The contribution is a practical, mathematically grounded approach
achieving harmony between AI capability and human
accountability—directly addressing the IS 2026 theme of “Seeking Wa in
Systems Engineering.” The framework enables organizations to adopt AI
assistance confidently while maintaining clear, auditable chains of
human responsibility for document quality.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>When artificial intelligence assists in creating systems engineering
documentation, who bears responsibility for the result? This question
has moved from philosophical abstraction to practical urgency. The 2024
DORA State of DevOps Report reveals that 76% of developers now use AI
tools daily, yet delivery stability has decreased by 7.2%.¹ AI
assistance is accelerating, but accountability structures have not kept
pace.</p>
<p>The systems engineering community recognizes this challenge. INCOSE’s
International Symposium 2026 introduces mandatory AI assistance
disclosure requirements, signaling institutional awareness that
AI-generated content requires new accountability mechanisms.² The
symposium theme—“Beyond Digital Engineering: Seeking Wa in
SE”—explicitly calls for harmony between human judgment and
technological capability.³ Yet recognition of a problem differs from its
solution.</p>
<h3 id="the-accountability-gap">1.1 The Accountability Gap</h3>
<p>Barry Boehm’s classic formulation distinguishes verification (“Are we
building the product right?”) from validation (“Are we building the
right product?”).⁴ This distinction has guided systems engineering for
four decades, codified in IEEE 1012⁵ and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288.⁶ But
traditional frameworks treat verification and validation as separate
activities. A document may pass structural verification—correct format,
required sections present, word count within limits—while failing
validation because it does not serve its intended purpose. Conversely, a
document may demonstrate fitness-for-purpose while violating structural
requirements. Neither condition alone constitutes assured quality.</p>
<p>The missing element is formal coupling. Structural requirements
(specifications) define what must be present; quality criteria
(guidance) define what makes content effective. These naturally pair:
one cannot meaningfully verify a document against a specification while
validating it against unrelated guidance. Yet existing frameworks do not
formalize this relationship, leaving it implicit or ignored.</p>
<p>A second gap concerns accountability for validation. Verification can
be automated: checking word counts, section presence, and format
compliance requires no judgment. Validation is inherently
subjective—assessing whether content is clear, rigorous, or practically
useful requires human evaluation. When AI assists in generating content,
who is responsible for judging its fitness? The answer cannot be “the
AI” because language models cannot bear accountability. It must be a
named human who reviewed, evaluated, and approved.</p>
<h3 id="our-contribution">1.2 Our Contribution</h3>
<p>This paper presents a framework addressing both gaps. We model
document assurance using typed simplicial complexes from algebraic
topology.⁷ Documents, specifications, and guidance become vertices.
Verification, validation, and coupling become edges connecting them.
When a document is verified against a specification, validated against
coupled guidance, and the coupling relationship is explicit, the three
edges form a triangular face—a 2-simplex in topological terms. This face
represents complete assurance: structural compliance plus
fitness-for-purpose plus explicit coupling, with human accountability
attributed for validation.</p>
<p>The framework makes three specific contributions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Structural accountability enforcement</strong> through typed
simplicial complexes where validation edges cannot exist without a named
<code>human_approver</code> field—making accountability structurally
required rather than merely recommended</li>
<li><strong>Explicit coupling of specification and guidance</strong>
through coupling edges that formally pair verification criteria with
validation criteria, preventing misalignment</li>
<li><strong>Assurance triangles as 2-simplices</strong> that require all
three relationships (verification, coupling, validation) for complete
assurance, enabling topological auditing</li>
</ol>
<p>We demonstrate the framework through self-reference. This paper is
not merely a description but an instance: it exists as a vertex in its
own assurance complex, verified against a specification we developed,
validated against corresponding guidance, with the assurance triangle
completed by human approval. Four assured supporting
documents—architecture, lifecycle, literature review, and novel
contributions—provide the intellectual foundation. If you are reading
this paper in the symposium proceedings, the framework succeeded—the
demonstration is the proof.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="background-and-related-work">2. Background and Related Work</h2>
<h3 id="verification-and-validation-foundations">2.1 Verification and
Validation Foundations</h3>
<p>The distinction between verification and validation traces to Boehm’s
1984 IEEE Software paper, which posed the questions that have guided
quality assurance since: “Are we building the product right?”
(verification) and “Are we building the right product?” (validation).⁴
IEEE Standard 1012-2016 codifies verification and validation processes
for systems, software, and hardware, defining integrity levels and
process requirements.⁵ ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2023 establishes verification
and validation as distinct life cycle processes within the broader
systems engineering framework.⁶</p>
<p>These standards treat verification and validation as complementary
but separate. Verification confirms that outputs conform to specified
requirements; validation confirms that outputs satisfy stakeholder
needs. What the standards do not formalize is the relationship between
the requirements against which we verify and the criteria against which
we validate. In practice, these should correspond—we verify structure
against a specification and validate quality against guidance that
interprets what “good” means for documents meeting that specification.
But this coupling remains implicit in current frameworks.</p>
<p>The INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook elaborates verification and
validation within the context of system life cycle processes.⁸ It
emphasizes that validation assesses fitness for intended use,
necessarily involving stakeholder judgment. This subjective
element—human judgment about fitness—becomes critical when AI generates
content. The handbook does not address who bears responsibility when
content originates from automated systems.</p>
<h3 id="the-v-model-and-systems-engineering-lifecycle">2.2 The V-Model
and Systems Engineering Lifecycle</h3>
<p>The “Vee” model for systems engineering was first publicly presented
by Forsberg and Mooz at the 1991 NCOSE Conference.⁹ Their foundational
paper established the graphical representation that has guided systems
engineering lifecycle thinking for three decades: the left side of the V
represents decomposition and specification (conceptual through physical
design), while the right side represents integration and verification
(component testing through acceptance).²⁰ The V-model explicitly maps
verification and validation activities to corresponding design
activities at each level of abstraction.</p>
<p>The INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook, now in its fifth edition,
elaborates the V-model within modern life cycle processes.⁸ The handbook
describes four architectural layers that structure system design:
conceptual (stakeholder needs and operational context), functional (what
the system must do), logical (design-independent component structure),
and physical (specific implementation choices). Each layer on the left
side of the V corresponds to a verification level on the right:
conceptual requirements are validated through acceptance testing,
functional requirements through system testing, logical architecture
through integration testing, and physical design through unit
testing.</p>
<p>This four-layer framework aligns with other major architecture
standards. The Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF)
organizes views across operational, systems, and technical perspectives,
with the Concept of Operations (ConOps) providing the operational
context that drives architectural decisions.²¹ NASA’s Systems
Engineering Handbook similarly structures design through logical
decomposition—from conceptual architecture through functional analysis
to physical integration—with verification “unwinding the process” to
test whether each physical level meets the expectations and
requirements.²²</p>
<p>Our framework operationalizes this V-model structure for documents. A
specification defines what must be present at each level (structural
requirements); guidance defines what constitutes quality at each level
(assessment criteria). The coupling edge formalizes what the V-model
leaves implicit: that the verification standard and validation criteria
must correspond. The assurance triangle completes the loop that the
V-model depicts graphically.</p>
<h3 id="algebraic-topology-and-simplicial-complexes">2.3 Algebraic
Topology and Simplicial Complexes</h3>
<p>Algebraic topology studies shapes through algebraic invariants,
enabling rigorous analysis of structural properties.⁷ A simplicial
complex is a combinatorial structure built from simplices: vertices
(0-simplices), edges (1-simplices), triangles (2-simplices), and
higher-dimensional analogs.¹⁰ The power of simplicial complexes lies in
their ability to capture relationships at multiple levels—not just
pairwise connections (edges) but higher-order relationships (faces).</p>
<p>Carlsson’s 2009 survey established topology as a tool for data
analysis, demonstrating that topological invariants reveal structural
features invisible to traditional statistics.¹¹ Ghrist’s work spans both
theoretical foundations and accessible exposition—from the barcodes
paper introducing persistent homology¹² to the comprehensive textbook
<em>Elementary Applied Topology</em>¹³ that makes these methods
accessible to engineers.</p>
<p>The Euler characteristic χ = V - E + F provides a simple but powerful
invariant: for a well-formed complex, this quantity reveals topological
properties independent of specific representation. Reimann et
al. applied directed clique complexes to brain networks, showing that
Euler characteristic serves as a meaningful network invariant.¹⁴ We
adopt this principle for document assurance: topological invariants
audit structural integrity.</p>
<h3 id="test-driven-development">2.4 Test-Driven Development</h3>
<p>Kent Beck’s formulation of test-driven development (TDD) inverts the
traditional code-then-test sequence: write tests first, then write code
to pass them.¹⁵ The red-green-refactor cycle—failing test, passing
implementation, improved design—creates a rhythm of specification-first
development. Tests become executable specifications that code must
satisfy.</p>
<p>Extending TDD to documentation treats specifications as tests that
documents must pass. A document specification defines required
structure: sections, fields, formats, constraints. A document either
satisfies these requirements or fails. This binary outcome mirrors unit
tests: pass or fail, no ambiguity.</p>
<p>But TDD for documentation requires extension. Code tests verify
behavior; they do not assess whether the code solves the right problem.
Similarly, specification compliance verifies structure but not quality.
The extension requires coupling: specifications (structural tests)
paired with guidance (quality criteria). Only both together constitute
complete quality assurance.</p>
<h3 id="ai-ethics-and-accountability">2.5 AI Ethics and
Accountability</h3>
<p>Floridi and Cowls propose five principles for AI in society:
beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability.¹⁶
The fifth principle—explicability—comprises intelligibility (how the
system works) and accountability (who is responsible for outcomes). For
AI-assisted documentation, intelligibility means understanding what the
AI contributed; accountability means attributing responsibility for the
result.</p>
<p>UNESCO’s 2021 Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial
Intelligence, adopted by all 194 member states, establishes global
standards emphasizing transparency, human oversight, and
accountability.¹⁷ The UN High-Level Advisory Body on AI reinforces these
principles in its 2024 governance framework, calling for “accountability
anchored in human responsibility.”¹⁸</p>
<p>What existing work lacks is a practical mechanism for accountability.
Principles are valuable but insufficient. We need schemas that require
accountability attribution, processes that enforce human review, and
auditing that detects gaps.</p>
<p>From a systems engineering perspective, AI agents are fundamentally
not self-governing—every autonomous system is deployed <em>by
someone</em>, and there is always an accountable stakeholder.²³ Agency
requires a principal who provisions, deploys, and monitors the system.
Autonomy does not eliminate oversight; rather, it represents delegated
control within clearly defined parameters. The principal defines the
mission, establishes constraints, and retains responsibility for
outcomes. LLMs are tools embedded within larger systems, not autonomous
agents themselves—they generate text but lack persistent goals or
feedback loops. True agency emerges from orchestrated systems where
humans retain accountability.</p>
<p>Our framework provides these mechanisms through structural
requirements: validation edges cannot exist without a named human
approver.</p>
<h3 id="prior-art-ghrists-the-forge">2.6 Prior Art: Ghrist’s “The
Forge”</h3>
<p>Robert Ghrist’s Appendix C “The Forge” in <em>The Geometry of Heaven
&amp; Hell</em> (2025) documents the only known methodology for
AI-assisted scholarly writing with explicit human accountability.¹⁹
Notably, Ghrist’s topological mathematics (barcodes, persistent
homology) also informs our simplicial complex model.</p>
<p>Ghrist’s key methodological insight: “Every sentence in this book
passed through my judgment; every connection earned my conviction; every
claim bears my responsibility.”</p>
<p><strong>Distinction from our approach:</strong> Ghrist’s methodology
is <em>procedural</em>—it documents how he wrote a book through
disciplined practice. Our framework is <em>structural</em>—it formalizes
accountability through typed simplicial complexes where validation edges
cannot exist without a <code>human_approver</code> field. Ghrist
demonstrates accountability can be achieved; we demonstrate it can be
enforced.</p>

<h3 id="logical-layer-design-independent-components">3.3 Logical Layer:
Design-Independent Components</h3>
<p>The design-independent component structure uses typed simplicial
complexes:</p>
<h4 id="an-optimization-intuition">An Optimization Intuition</h4>
<p>The framework can be understood through the lens of constrained
optimization. Consider intellectual substance—research findings, design
decisions, analytical insights—that must be expressed for publication. A
document is the <em>serialized representation</em> of this intellectual
substance, projected onto a document space defined by the
specification.</p>
<p>The specification defines the <em>feasible region</em>: structural
constraints that any valid document must satisfy (word limits, required
sections, format rules). Verification checks feasibility—is this
serialization structurally valid?</p>
<p>The guidance defines the <em>objective function</em>: quality
criteria that distinguish better representations from worse ones within
the feasible region (clarity, rigor, relevance). Validation evaluates
the objective—how well does this serialization serve its purpose?</p>
<p>Writing is then a projection operation: projecting intellectual
substance onto the document space characterized by the specification,
with the guidance providing direction for selecting among alternative
feasible representations. Different phrasings, organizations, or
emphases may all satisfy the spec (all feasible), but the guidance helps
choose which serialization best communicates the underlying
substance.</p>
<p>This framing clarifies the verification-validation distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong> answers: “Is this point in the
feasible region?” (Binary: pass/fail)</li>
<li><strong>Validation</strong> answers: “How good is this feasible
point?” (Qualitative: assessment with rationale)</li>
</ul>
<p>The coupling edge ensures we optimize the right objective over the
right feasible region—we cannot accidentally verify against one spec
while optimizing for unrelated guidance.</p>
<h4 id="typed-simplicial-complex-structure">Typed Simplicial Complex
Structure</h4>
<p><strong>Vertices (0-simplices)</strong> are documents of three types:
- <em>Specifications</em> define structural requirements: required
sections, fields, formats, constraints. They answer “what must be
present?” - <em>Guidance</em> documents define quality criteria: how to
evaluate effectiveness, clarity, rigor. They answer “what makes it
good?” - <em>Content</em> documents are the artifacts being assured:
papers, reports, requirements, designs.</p>
<p><strong>Edges (1-simplices)</strong> are relationships of three
types: - <em>Verification edges</em> connect content to specifications,
asserting structural compliance. - <em>Validation edges</em> connect
content to guidance, asserting fitness-for-purpose. These require a
named human approver. - <em>Coupling edges</em> connect specifications
to guidance, asserting correspondence between structural and qualitative
requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Faces (2-simplices)</strong> are assurance triangles: when a
content document has a verification edge to a specification, that
specification has a coupling edge to guidance, and the content has a
validation edge to that same guidance, the three edges bound a
triangular face representing complete assurance.</p>
<p><strong>The Assurance Triangle:</strong></p>
<pre><code>          doc
         /   \
  verification  validation
       /         \
      /           \
    spec ------- guidance
         coupling</code></pre>
<p>An assurance face closes when three edges form a valid triangle:
verification (doc→spec), validation (doc→guidance), and coupling
(spec↔︎guidance). The face attests that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The document is structurally compliant (verification passed)</li>
<li>The document meets quality criteria (validation passed)</li>
<li>The spec and guidance are properly coupled</li>
<li>A human has reviewed and approved the complete pattern</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Accountability Model:</strong> Every validation edge and
assurance face requires human accountability. When LLM-assisted,
<code>human_approver</code> is REQUIRED—the human takes responsibility
for the assessment. This is not optional; it is structurally enforced
through schema validation.</p>
<h4 id="edge-payload-structures">Edge Payload Structures</h4>
<p>Verification and validation edges carry distinct payloads reflecting
their different natures. A verification edge documents deterministic
structural checks:</p>

<p>The validation payload contains qualitative assessments with
rationale. Critically, it includes the <code>human_approver</code>
field—without this, the validation edge is structurally invalid. The LLM
assists; the human approves and bears accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Boundary Complex:</strong> The framework bootstraps through
four foundational vertices (spec-for-spec, spec-for-guidance,
guidance-for-spec, guidance-for-guidance) connected in a
self-referential pattern. A root vertex (b0:root) resolves the
self-referential paradox by anchoring boundary faces. The boundary
complex satisfies the invariant V - F = 1, where the “one” is the root
vertex—the only vertex not requiring its own assurance face.</p>
<p><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Components integrate correctly
when assurance faces close properly (all three edges present),
cross-references resolve, and the V - F = 1 invariant computes
correctly.</p>

<p>Each supporting document was verified against its specification,
validated against its guidance by a named human approver (mzargham), and
closed into an assurance triangle before being used as input to this
paper. The consistency of terminology and concepts across all five
documents (including this paper) is enforced through explicit
cross-referencing and validation criteria.</p>
<h3 id="incose-paper-type">4.2 INCOSE Paper Type</h3>
<p>We created specification and guidance documents for INCOSE papers
derived from the IS 2026 Call for Papers:</p>
<p><strong>spec-for-incose-paper</strong> (v2.0.0) defines: - 7,000 word
limit (REQUIRED) - 12 required sections (Title through Author Biography)
- Abstract: 150-300 words - AI disclosure requirements per INCOSE 2026
guidelines - INCOSE template format - 15 validation rules (V1-V15)</p>
<p><strong>guidance-for-incose-paper</strong> (v2.0.0) defines: - Six
quality criteria: Relevance, Accessibility, Rigor, Novelty, Theme
Alignment, Engagement - Section-by-section authoring guidance - Scoring
rubric with 24 maximum points (4 points × 6 criteria) - Target: ≥20/24
for acceptance recommendation</p>
<h3 id="dual-assurance">4.3 Dual Assurance</h3>
<p>This paper is assured against two spec/guidance pairs (independent
triangles):</p>
<p><strong>Level 1 (Base INCOSE Paper Type):</strong> - Verified against
<code>spec-for-incose-paper</code> (15 rules) - Validated against
<code>guidance-for-incose-paper</code> (6 criteria, target ≥20/24) -
Coupling: <code>coupling-incose-paper</code></p>
<p><strong>Level 2 (Self-Demonstrating Paper Type):</strong> - Verified
against <code>spec-for-incose-self-demonstration</code> (12 extended
rules) - Validated against
<code>guidance-for-incose-self-demonstration</code> (7 additional
criteria) - Coupling:
<code>coupling-incose-self-demonstration</code></p>
<p>The self-demonstration specification requires: - <strong>Consistency
(C1-C4)</strong>: Terminology and concepts match all four supporting
documents - <strong>Completeness (CP1-CP4)</strong>: All supporting
document content adequately represented - <strong>Self-Demonstration
(SD1-SD3)</strong>: Paper serves as instance, includes concrete
evidence, demonstrates recursive consistency</p>
<h3 id="the-boundary-complex">4.4 The Boundary Complex</h3>
<p>Before presenting the full audit, we explain the foundation that
makes auditing possible. The boundary complex resolves a potential
paradox: what assures the specification for specifications?</p>
<p>Consider the foundational documents: - <strong>Spec-for-spec</strong>
must be verified against… a specification. Which specification? Itself.
- <strong>Guidance-for-guidance</strong> must be validated against…
guidance. Which guidance? Itself.</p>
<p>Self-reference seems unavoidable. But self-referential assurance
creates topological problems: a document cannot be a vertex in its own
assurance triangle without degeneracy.</p>
<p>The root vertex resolves this by providing the third point. The root
vertex sits outside the typed system—it is not a spec, guidance, or
content document. It exists solely to close boundary faces, transforming
logically valid but topologically incomplete assurances into proper
2-simplices. This is not circular reasoning but explicit axiomatization:
the framework declares its foundations rather than hiding them.</p>
<h3 id="complete-assurance-audit">4.5 Complete Assurance Audit</h3>
<p>The assurance audit uses <code>audit_assurance_chart.py</code>, which
analyzes chart documents for completeness by matching every vertex
(except root) to the face that assures it, and checks the V - F = 1
invariant.</p>

<p><strong>Vertex Categories:</strong> - Boundary complex: 5 vertices
(root + 4 foundational) - INCOSE paper type: 4 vertices (spec, guidance,
self-demo spec, self-demo guidance) - Supporting document types: 8
vertices (4 types × spec + guidance) - Supporting document instances: 4
vertices (architecture, lifecycle, lit review, novel contributions) -
This paper: 1 vertex - Coupling edges close assurance triangles for
each</p>
<h3 id="reference-vs.-referent-the-audit-charts-self-reference">4.6
Reference vs. Referent: The Audit Chart’s Self-Reference</h3>
<p>A subtle but important distinction: the audit chart is both a
<em>document</em> (a vertex in the complex) and a <em>reference</em> to
a topological object (the complex itself). This dual nature requires
careful handling.</p>
<p>The audit chart exists as a markdown file with YAML frontmatter—it is
a document that can be verified against <code>spec-for-chart</code> and
validated against <code>guidance-for-chart</code>. As a document, it is
a vertex.</p>
<p>But the audit chart also <em>references</em> a topological structure:
24 vertices, many edges, 23 faces. This referent—the mathematical
object—is not the same as the reference (the document describing it).
The audit chart document is a vertex, auditable using spec and guidance
for charts, which are themselves auditable against the boundary
complex.</p>
<p>The spec for audit charts requires element data in YAML frontmatter
and encodes rules about every vertex requiring an assurance face.
Running verification on an audit chart also systematically checks that
all vertices therein are assured.</p>
<p>This referent/reference distinction enables controlled
self-reference—similar to how the boundary complex enables
self-referential specifications. The audit chart document can include
itself in its vertex list, with the framework’s formal structure
preventing paradox.</p>
<h3 id="discovered-and-addressed-issues">4.7 Discovered and Addressed
Issues</h3>
<p>The self-demonstration revealed a tooling gap. Initial audit runs
showed 85.7% coverage instead of 100%. Investigation revealed that the
audit script inferred assurance face targets from naming conventions
rather than reading explicit <code>target:</code> fields in face
metadata.</p>
<p>This gap was discovered, diagnosed, and fixed during framework
application:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Discovery</strong>: Audit reported the paper content vertex
as unassured</li>
<li><strong>Diagnosis</strong>: Script used naming pattern matching
instead of explicit metadata</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong>: Added <code>get_face_target()</code> function
to read explicit target fields</li>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: Re-ran audit; 100% coverage
achieved</li>
</ol>
<p>This sequence demonstrates the framework operating: a gap was
detected through systematic auditing, root cause was identified, fix was
implemented, and verification confirmed resolution. The meta-observation
is that the framework’s tooling caught a tooling defect—the
self-referential nature of the demonstration strengthened rather than
undermined confidence.</p>
<h3 id="recursive-proof">4.8 Recursive Proof</h3>
<p>The framework’s central claim—that typed simplicial complexes can
enforce human accountability for document quality—is demonstrated by
this paper’s existence:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This paper cannot exist as an assured vertex without passing
verification</li>
<li>Verification cannot pass without structural compliance with
specification</li>
<li>This paper cannot be assured without passing validation</li>
<li>Validation cannot pass without a named human approver</li>
<li>This paper exists as an assured vertex</li>
<li>Therefore: A human approved this paper’s fitness-for-purpose</li>
</ol>
<p>The proof is structural, not procedural. The
<code>human_approver</code> field is required by the type system—not by
policy, but by data structure.</p>

<h2 id="engineering-lifecycle">5. Engineering Lifecycle</h2>
<p>The framework enacts a four-phase lifecycle aligned with the V-model.
This section describes how this paper was actually produced.</p>
<h3 id="phase-1-document-type-definition">5.1 Phase 1: Document Type
Definition</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Create assured specification and guidance
defining what constitutes a valid document.</p>
<p><strong>Activities:</strong> 1. Analyze INCOSE IS 2026 Call for
Papers requirements 2. Create <code>spec-for-incose-paper</code>
capturing structural requirements 3. Create
<code>guidance-for-incose-paper</code> defining quality criteria 4.
Verify both against foundational documents (spec-for-spec,
guidance-for-guidance) 5. Create coupling edge linking spec to guidance
6. Close assurance triangles with human approval</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> Assured INCOSE paper type (spec + guidance +
coupling)</p>
<p><strong>Verification Gate:</strong> Type documents pass template
verification before proceeding.</p>
<h3 id="phase-2-architecture-and-content-development">5.2 Phase 2:
Architecture and Content Development</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Create assured supporting documents
capturing the intellectual framework.</p>
<p><strong>Activities:</strong> 1. Create architecture document using
4-layer model 2. Create lifecycle document describing the process 3.
Create literature review organizing prior work 4. Create novel
contributions ranking intellectual contributions 5. Verify each against
its spec; validate each against its guidance 6. Close assurance
triangles with human approval</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> Four assured supporting documents</p>
<p><strong>Verification Gate:</strong> All supporting documents pass
verification and validation before use in paper.</p>
<h3 id="phase-3-content-assembly-iterative">5.3 Phase 3: Content
Assembly (Iterative)</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Synthesize supporting documents into paper
meeting dual assurance requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Activities:</strong> 1. Structure paper sections to mirror
literature review themes (SD4 compliance) 2. Map architecture layers to
Framework section (SD2 compliance) 3. Include lifecycle narrative in
Section 5 (SD3 compliance) 4. Use novel contributions ranking for
emphasis (SD5 compliance) 5. Iterate until verification passes and
validation achieves target score 6. Create verification and validation
edges for both spec/guidance pairs</p>
<p><strong>Convergence Criteria:</strong> - Base verification: 100% of
applicable checks pass - Base validation: ≥20/24 on 6-criteria rubric -
Self-demo verification: 100% of extended checks pass - Self-demo
validation: ≥40/52 on 13-criteria rubric</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> Assured paper with dual assurance
triangles</p>
<h3 id="phase-4-post-processing">5.4 Phase 4: Post-Processing</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Transform assured source to submittable
artifact.</p>
<p><strong>Activities:</strong> 1. Generate PDF from markdown source 2.
Apply INCOSE template formatting 3. Strip YAML frontmatter for
submission 4. Verify word count in final format 5. Document traceability
from PDF to source</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledged Gap:</strong> The verified source (markdown in
repository) differs from the submitted artifact (PDF). Mitigation: the
source repository remains the authoritative record of assurance status;
the PDF is a derived artifact with documented transformation.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> Submission-ready PDF with explicit source
traceability</p>
<h3 id="lifecycle-visualization">5.5 Lifecycle Visualization</h3>
<p>Figure 1 presents the complete assured document development
lifecycle, showing how foundation documents enable custom type
definition (Phase 1), architecture development (Phase 2), iterative
content development (Phase 3), and post-processing for submission (Phase
4). Verification loops (automated) and validation loops (human) are
explicit at each phase.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Assured Document Development Lifecycle.
The boundary complex (Phase 0) provides the trusted foundation. Document
type definition (Phase 1) and supporting document creation (Phase 2) can
proceed in parallel. Content assembly (Phase 3) iterates through
verification and validation loops until convergence. Post-processing
(Phase 4) transforms assured source to submittable artifact with
acknowledged traceability gap.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">6. Discussion</h2>
<h3 id="key-findings">6.1 Key Findings</h3>
<p>The self-demonstration succeeds: this paper exists, was verified
against its specification, validated against its guidance, and both
assurance triangles closed with human approval. Three findings merit
emphasis:</p>
<p><strong>Structural accountability is the critical
innovation.</strong> Where Ghrist’s “The Forge” demonstrates that
procedural accountability is achievable through disciplined practice,
our framework demonstrates it can be <em>enforced</em>. The
<code>human_approver</code> field is not optional; validation edges
without it fail type verification. This transforms accountability from a
process recommendation to a structural requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Explicit coupling prevents misalignment.</strong> Traditional
V&amp;V frameworks leave the specification-guidance relationship
implicit. Making it explicit through coupling edges ensures that
verification and validation assess the same coherent “document type.”
Without coupling, a paper could pass verification against INCOSE
requirements while being validated against IEEE criteria—the mismatch
invisible until peer review failure.</p>
<p><strong>Topological structure enables auditing.</strong> The V - F =
1 invariant provides an efficient integrity check. Every non-root vertex
requires exactly one assurance face; every face assures exactly one
vertex. Violations indicate either unassured vertices or malformed
structure. This makes requirements traceability computationally
verifiable.</p>
<h3 id="connection-to-seeking-wa">6.2 Connection to “Seeking Wa”</h3>
<p>The IS 2026 theme calls for harmony between human capability and
technological tools.³ This framework embodies that harmony: it embraces
LLM contributions while requiring human accountability for subjective
judgments.</p>
<p>The assurance triangle formalizes what “Seeking Wa” means for
documentation: the dynamic balance between automated checking
(verification) and human judgment (validation), coupled through explicit
relationship. The LLM contributes capability (drafting, analysis,
organization). The human contributes responsibility (judgment, approval,
accountability). Neither dominates; both contribute according to their
strengths.</p>
<h3 id="limitations">6.3 Limitations</h3>
<p><strong>Single implementation.</strong> This paper is one
demonstration. The framework’s value at scale remains to be validated
across organizations, document types, and time.</p>
<p><strong>Framework overhead.</strong> Creating specifications and
guidance for each document type requires investment. The framework is
most valuable for high-stakes or repeatedly-used document types where
the overhead is amortized.</p>
<p><strong>Good-faith assumption.</strong> The framework detects missing
approvals but cannot ensure approval quality. A rubber-stamp approval is
structurally valid but substantively hollow. Mitigation: validator
whitelisting and CI enforcement that committer matches signer.</p>
<p><strong>Post-processing gap.</strong> The verified source (markdown)
differs from the submitted artifact (PDF). Future work should integrate
publication pipeline steps into the assurance framework itself.</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility of topology.</strong> Simplicial complexes and
boundary operators may intimidate practitioners unfamiliar with
algebraic topology. The concepts are simpler than they appear—triangles
with named edges—but the terminology creates barriers.</p>
<h3 id="implications-for-practice">6.4 Implications for Practice</h3>
<p>Organizations can adopt the framework incrementally:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Start with specification-guidance pairs.</strong> For
each document type, develop explicit specifications and corresponding
guidance. Link them through coupling edges.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Add verification.</strong> Implement template-based
verification checking documents against specifications. This can be
automated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduce validation with accountability.</strong> For
documents requiring quality judgment, implement validation edges with
mandatory human approvers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build assurance faces and audit.</strong> Assemble
complete triangles. Test the V - F = 1 invariant. Identify
gaps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trace to foundations.</strong> Establish boundary
complexes for foundational types. Make axioms explicit.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have presented a framework for document assurance using typed
simplicial complexes, addressing accountability gaps in AI-assisted
documentation through three innovations: structural accountability
enforcement, explicit coupling of specifications and guidance, and
assurance triangles as complete quality attestation.</p>
<h3 id="key-contributions">7.1 Key Contributions</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Structural Accountability Enforcement</strong>: Human
accountability is required by the type system, not just recommended by
policy. Validation edges cannot exist without
<code>human_approver</code>. “The Forge demonstrates accountability is
achievable; we demonstrate it can be enforced.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explicit Coupling of Specification and Guidance</strong>:
The coupling edge formally links verification criteria with validation
criteria, ensuring coherent assessment and closing the gap in
traditional V&amp;V.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assurance Triangle as 2-Simplex</strong>: Using algebraic
topology to model document assurance enables topological invariants (V -
F = 1) for auditing and composition rules from simplicial complex
theory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Self-Demonstrating Proof</strong>: The framework’s
viability is demonstrated by this paper’s existence as an assured vertex
with four assured supporting documents—the recursive proof is our
primary empirical result.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="key-insights">7.2 Key Insights</h3>
<p>From our eight novel contributions, three key insights for the SE
community:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Lead with structural accountability</strong>: The key
differentiation from procedural approaches is that we formalize
accountability as enforceable structure, not documented
process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Position coupling as core innovation</strong>: The
explicit relationship between verification and validation is what’s
missing from existing V&amp;V frameworks. The coupling edge answers “how
do verification and validation relate?”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Math provides precision, not just metaphor</strong>:
Simplicial complexes enable topological invariants, auditing, and
composition rules—they are engineering tools, not decoration.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="future-work">7.3 Future Work</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integration with MBSE tools for model verification</li>
<li>Multi-organization deployment to validate scalability</li>
<li>Application of persistent homology to track assurance evolution over
time</li>
<li>Composition patterns for large document ecosystems</li>
</ul>
<p>As AI capabilities advance, human accountability becomes more rather
than less important. The framework provides practical mechanisms for
maintaining that accountability while embracing AI assistance—achieving
the harmony between human and machine that systems engineering
requires.</p>

generation:</strong> Drafting all sections based on framework
understanding and four assured supporting documents -
<strong>Analysis:</strong> Generating verification outputs, quality
assessments, and assurance documentation - <strong>Conceptual:</strong>
Framework architecture emerged through iterative human-AI
collaboration</p>
<p><strong>Author involvement:</strong> The framework architecture,
research questions, and all accountability decisions are original author
work. The author directed all AI-assisted content generation, made all
editorial decisions, and approved all supporting document assurance. The
self-demonstration (using the framework to write itself) was conceived
and orchestrated by the author. Claude projected intellectual substance
onto the document space characterized by the specification and guidance
documents.</p>
<p><strong>Human accountability:</strong> The named human approver
(mzargham) reviewed all AI-generated content and takes full
responsibility for the paper’s claims and conclusions. All validation
edges and assurance faces in the supporting infrastructure bear the
<code>human_approver: mzargham</code> attribution.</p>
<p>This disclosure follows the methodological precedent established in
Ghrist’s “The Forge,”¹⁹ which documents a comparable process of
AI-assisted authorship where the human provides intellectual substance,
direction, oversight, and approval while AI contributes drafting
capability.</p>
