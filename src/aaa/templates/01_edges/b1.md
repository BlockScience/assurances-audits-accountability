# <Display Name>

This is a **boundary edge (b1)** connecting a standard vertex to the boundary anchor (b0:root).

## Edge Properties

- **Type:** b1 (Boundary Edge)
- **Source:** `<source vertex>`
- **Target:** `<target vertex>`
- **Orientation:** Directed
- **Role:** <Describe the role (self-verification, self-validation, couples)>

## Semantics

Boundary edges (b1) serve special functions in resolving self-referential paradoxes:

- **b1:self-verification**: Represents self-verification of foundational specs, anchored via root
- **b1:self-validation**: Represents self-validation of foundational guidance, anchored via root
- **b1:couples-*-root**: Couples boundary vertices to root as proxy for standard coupling

## Boundary Faces

This boundary edge participates in boundary faces (b2):

- <List b2 faces that include this edge>

## Comparison to Standard Edges

| Property | Standard Edge | Boundary Edge (b1) |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Connects to root | No | Yes |
| Purpose | Standard relationships | Resolve self-reference |
| Face type | Standard (f:) | Boundary (b2:) |
| Orientation | Directed/Undirected | Directed to/from root |

## Related Elements

- **Boundary Vertex (b0)**: <The root vertex>
- **Boundary Faces (b2)**: <List related b2 faces>
- **Standard Vertices**: <List standard vertices this edge connects>

**Note:** Boundary edges (b1) only appear in boundary faces (b2) and always involve the unique b0:root vertex. They enable self-referential foundational documents to achieve valid assurance triangles.
