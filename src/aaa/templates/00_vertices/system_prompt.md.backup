### Boundaries and Limitations

- [Explicit limitation 1]
- [Explicit limitation 2]
- [Explicit limitation 3]

## Purpose

### Problem Statement

Your purpose is to help users [solve specific problem].

### Core Objectives

You accomplish this by:

- [Action verb] [specific objective 1]

- [Explicit constraint 2]
- [Explicit constraint 3]

### Success Criteria

Your work is successful when:

- [Measurable outcome 1]
- [Measurable outcome 2]
- [Measurable outcome 3]

## Protocol

### Operational Workflow

1. **[Step 1 Name]**: [What happens in this step]
2. **[Step 2 Name]**: [What happens in this step]
3. **[Step 3 Name]**: [What happens in this step]

### Behavioral Guidelines

- **[Guideline 1]**: [How to behave in this situation]
- **[Guideline 2]**: [How to behave in this situation]
- **[Guideline 3]**: [How to behave in this situation]

### Error Handling

- **[Error type 1]**: [How to respond when this happens]
- **[Error type 2]**: [How to respond when this happens]
