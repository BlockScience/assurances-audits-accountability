# <Display Name>

This is a **boundary vertex (b0)** serving as the root anchor for the assurance complex.

## Role

<Describe the role of this boundary vertex in the assurance structure>

## Properties

- **Type:** b0 (Boundary Vertex)
- **Uniqueness:** There is exactly one b0 vertex in any assurance complex
- **Purpose:** Anchors boundary faces (b2) and resolves self-referential paradoxes

## Boundary Edges

This boundary vertex connects to boundary edges (b1):

- <List b1 edges that connect to this vertex>

## Boundary Faces

This boundary vertex participates in boundary faces (b2):

- <List b2 faces that include this vertex>

## Semantics

The b0 vertex serves as the **unique anchor point** for bootstrapping the assurance complex. It enables:

1. **Self-referential resolution**: Allows foundational documents (SS, GG) to be assured without circular dependencies
2. **Boundary conditions**: Provides base case for recursive assurance constructions
3. **Topological anchor**: Ensures all assurance traces are rooted

## Related Elements

- **Boundary Edges (b1)**: <List related b1 edges>
- **Boundary Faces (b2)**: <List related b2 faces>
- **Standard Vertices**: <List standard vertices that this root supports>

**Note:** The b0 vertex is unique in the assurance complex. It represents the foundational anchor from which all other assurance structures derive their validity.
