# Qualifies - mzargham for Self-Demonstration Guidance

This qualifies edge establishes that [[signer-mzargham]] is qualified to validate documents against [[guidance-for-incose-self-demonstration]].

## Qualification Description

**Signer:** [[signer-mzargham]]
**Guidance:** [[guidance-for-incose-self-demonstration]]
**Credential Type:** expertise

As the author of the self-demonstration concept and its guidance, mzargham has the expertise necessary to assess whether papers achieve genuine self-demonstration.

## Credential Evidence

- **Framework Authorship**: Designed the concept of self-demonstrating papers within the framework
- **Guidance Authorship**: Authored the guidance-for-incose-self-demonstration document
- **Implementation Experience**: Built the repository that serves as the self-demonstration evidence
- **Critical Perspective**: Understands the difference between genuine and superficial self-reference

## Scope and Limitations

**Scope:** Validation of documents claiming self-demonstration properties against guidance-for-incose-self-demonstration.

**Limitations:** Self-demonstration is inherently self-referential; external review adds independent verification.
