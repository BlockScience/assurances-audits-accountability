## Thematic Organization

### Theme 1: Systems Engineering Foundations

The INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook [INCOSE-SEH-2023] and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2023 [ISO-15288-2023] provide the foundational framework for systems engineering processes. IEEE 1012 [IEEE-1012-2016] establishes verification and validation standards. Boehm's classic distinction [Boehm-1984] between verification ("building the product right") and validation ("building the right product") remains fundamental.

### Theme 2: Mathematical Foundations (Topology)

Hatcher [Hatcher-2002] provides the mathematical foundation for algebraic topology. Edelsbrunner and Harer [Edelsbrunner-Harer-2010] bridge topology and computation. Carlsson's survey [Carlsson-2009] established topological data analysis as a field, and the foundational persistent homology algorithm paper [Zomorodian-Carlsson-2005] enables practical computation. Ghrist [Ghrist-2008] offers an accessible introduction to barcodes and persistence.

### Theme 3: AI Ethics and Accountability

Floridi's framework [Floridi-Cowls-2019] provides five principles for AI ethics, with "explicability" (intelligibility + accountability) as the key addition. His 2024 work [Floridi-2024] explores how AI exacerbates ethical challenges. UNESCO [UNESCO-2021] provides global standards, while the UN High-Level Advisory Body [UN-HLAB-2024] offers governance recommendations emphasizing transparency and human oversight.

### Theme 4: LLMs in Engineering

Recent research [Ahmad-2024] proposes frameworks for LLM systems engineering. The systematic literature review on LLMs for requirements engineering [Badshah-2024] shows explosive growth (136% increase 2023-2024). The DORA 2024 report [DORA-2024] provides empirical data on AI adoption impacts, including 7.5% documentation quality improvement but decreased delivery performance.

### Theme 5: Test-Driven Development

Beck's foundational work [Beck-2003] establishes TDD principles (red/green/refactor). The framework extends TDD to documentation by treating specifications as "tests" that documents must pass.
